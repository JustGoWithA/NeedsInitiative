# Introduction

>This is going to be quite the journery! Thanks for checking out my project. This will be the template of future endeavours.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Just reach out to me via e-mail or in the future I might start a slack/IRC to monitor these types of questions

# Ground Rules
> Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Your First Contribution

> Someday I will have a good way of doing this.

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

[source: [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)]  

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
* Just notify me to start, but in the future there will be a process to ensure compatibility. Contributing License Agreements will be needed if the project assumes anything in scale of an intellectual property as up to the disgression of the owner of the repository.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email ourslandaustin@gmail.com instead.

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on the issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

> No consistent process yet created.

# Community

> If this project expands, there will be community guidelines dictating how we all can communicate and grow the group.

# TODO:
### ADD MORE SECTIONS
### CREATE A CODE FORMAT EXAMPLE DOCUMENT
### BUILD UP NETWORKS FOR PROJECT SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION AND EMAIL SUPPORT
